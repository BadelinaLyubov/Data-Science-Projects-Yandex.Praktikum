| Project  | Descriptionr | Result | Used libraries |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Analysis of computer games](https://github.com/BadelinaLyubov/Data-Science-Projects-Yandex.Praktikum/tree/main/Educational_project_analysis_of_computer_games)  | Using data from open sources - historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, game genres and platforms for their launch, it is necessary to identify patterns that determine the success of the game  | Carried out: -preprocessing and analysis of available data, -user portraits were compiled, -several hypotheses were tested using the t-test  | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy  |
| [Analysis of business indicators of an entertainment application](https://github.com/BadelinaLyubov/Data-Science-Projects-Yandex.Praktikum/tree/main/Educational_project_Analysis_of_business_indicators)  | Data analysis is carried out for a company engaged in the development of entertainment applications. Using data on user visits, their orders and advertising expenses of the company, it is necessary to understand the reasons for the company's losses (with huge investments in advertising) and offer solutions for the company's entry into the plus  | Carried out: -preprocessing and analysis of available data, -evaluation of business indicators (TOPICS, ROI, conversions, retention), -identified the alleged causes of inefficiency in attracting users and -recommendations to the marketing department  | pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, datetime, numpy  |
| [A/B testing](https://github.com/BadelinaLyubov/Data-Science-Projects-Yandex.Praktikum/tree/main/Educational_project_A_B_testing)  | Launching an A/B research test and analyzing the results  | Carried out: -preprocessing and analysis of available data, -analysis of cumulative metrics (revenue, average receipt, average number of orders per visitor), -analysis of test results regarding the statistical significance of differences in "raw" and "purified" data using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test  | pandas, matplotlib, datetime, numpy, stats scipy  |
| [A/A/B testing for a mobile application](https://github.com/BadelinaLyubov/Data-Science-Projects-Yandex.Praktikum/tree/main/Educational_project_A_A_B_testing_for_a_mobile_application)  | It is necessary to understand the behavior of users of the mobile application for food sales. Investigate the results of A/A/B experiment to change fonts throughout the application  | Carried out: -preprocessing and analysis of available data, -quality control of testing, -a funnel of events was built and studied, -analysis of test results by papar comparisons using the z-test (testing the hypothesis of equality of shares - comparison of proportions of two general populations by samples from them)   | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, datetime, numpy, stats scipy  |
| [Graduation project - A/B testing](https://github.com/BadelinaLyubov/Data-Science-Projects-Yandex.Praktikum/tree/main/Graduation_project_A_B_testing)  | It is necessary to evaluate the results of A/B testing on changes related to the introduction of an improved recommendation system  | Carried out: -preprocessing and analysis of available data, -the correctness and quality of testing was evaluated, -a funnel of events was built, -analysis of test results using a z-test (testing the hypothesis of equality of shares - comparison of proportions of two general populations by samples from them)  | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, datetime, numpy, stats scipy  |
| [Graduation project - Analysis of customer churn](https://github.com/BadelinaLyubov/Data-Science-Projects-Yandex.Praktikum/tree/main/Graduation_project_Analysis_of_customer_churn)  | It is necessary to analyze the bank's customers and identify segments of customers who tend to leave the bank. So that in the future managers can identify and implement the impact on these segments to reduce customer puffiness  | Carried out: -preprocessing and analysis of available data, - categorization of some columns and addition of new columns, -hypothesis testing for statistically significant changes using a two-sided and one-sided t-test, -segmentation of users based on strategic indicators, -a conclusion was made and -recommendations were given   | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, numpy, stats scipy  |
