**The goal** is to understand the behavior of users of the mobile application for food sales. Investigate the results of A/A/B experiment to change fonts throughout the application


### Tasks:
- we will prepare the data for analysis and study them,
- we will study the sales funnel,
- find out how users reach the purchase, how many users reach, and how many "get stuck" and at what stages
- we will study the A/A/B test data for errors and low-quality data and interpret the results of the experiment


### Carried out:
- preprocessing and analysis of available data,
- quality control of testing,
- funnel of events was built and studied,
- analysis of test results by papar comparisons using the z-test (testing the hypothesis of equality of shares - comparison of proportions of two general populations by samples from them)


### Used Libraries:
- pandas,
- matplotlib,
- seaborn,
- plotly,
- datetime,
- numpy,
