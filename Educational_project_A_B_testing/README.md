**The goal** is to run an A/B test and analyze the results.

### Tasks:

- we will study the A/B test data for errors and low-quality data,
- we will derive and analyze cumulative metrics,
- analyze the statistical significance of differences in metrics and 
- we will make a decision based on the test results

 ### Carried out:
 - preprocessing and analysis of available data,
 - analysis of cumulative metrics (revenue, average receipt, average number of orders per visitor),
 - analysis of test results regarding the statistical significance of differences in "raw" and "purified" data using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test

### Used Libraries:
- pandas,
- matplotlib,
- datetime,
- numpy,
- stats scipy
